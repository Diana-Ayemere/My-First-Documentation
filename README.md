# My-First-Documentation

This is where I started my portfolio building while taking my Data Analysis class with the Incubator Hub.

I have learnt quite a number of things, ranging from Ms Excel, to SQL, and now to my Portfolio Building.

## Project Topic: DSA Employee Analysis

### Project Overview
DSA Employee Analysis is a beginner-friendly project designed to practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using a mock dataset of employees. The project focuses on applying key DSA concepts—such as sorting, searching, and data organization—to solve real-world-like problems using employee data (e.g., names, salaries, departments, and joining dates).

### Data Source
The data used for this project is a synthetic CSV file named employees.csv, created for practice purposes. It contains mock employee records and is not based on real-world data.

### Tools Used
- Ms Excel For data cleaning and preprocessing [Download Here](https;//www.microsoft.com)
