# My-First-Documentation

This is where I started my portfolio building while taking my Data Analysis class with the Incubator Hub.

I have learnt quite a number of things, ranging from Ms Excel, to SQL, and now to my Portfolio Building.

## Project Topic: DSA Employee Analysis

### Project Overview
DSA Employee Analysis is a beginner-friendly project designed to practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using a mock dataset of employees. The project focuses on applying key DSA concepts—such as sorting, searching, and data organization—to solve real-world-like problems using employee data (e.g., names, salaries, departments, and joining dates).

### Data Source
The data used for this project is a synthetic CSV file named employees.csv, created for practice purposes. It contains mock employee records and is not based on real-world data.

### Tools Used
- Ms Excel For data cleaning and preprocessing [Download Here](https;//www.microsoft.com)
    - For Data collection
    - Data Cleaning
      1. Data manipulation
      2. Data Munching
         
- SQL Server (For Querying and Analysis)
- Power BI (For Creating a Report)
- Ms Power Point (for Presentation)

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In this initial phase of the data cleaning and preparation, we perform the following actions;
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning ad formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
This involves exploring the dataset to gain insights and answer key questions such as:

  - Which department has the most employees?
  - What is the average salary?
  - Who has worked the longest in the company?

### Data Analysis
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of DAX expression used during your analysis

~~~  SQL
SELECT A,B,C
WHERE A> 15
