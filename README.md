I have learnt quite a number of things, ranging from Ms Excel, to SQL, and now to my Portfolio Building.

## Project Topic: DSA Employee Analysis

### Project Overview
DSA Employee Analysis is a beginner-friendly project designed to practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using a mock dataset of employees. The project focuses on applying key DSA concepts—such as sorting, searching, and data organization—to solve real-world-like problems using employee data (e.g., names, salaries, departments, and joining dates).
